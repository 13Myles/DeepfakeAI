    <h2>Applications of Deepfake AI</h2>
    
    <img src="img2.jpg" alt="Example of Deepfake AI" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
    <p>Here are two real-world examples of Deepfake AI in action:</p>
    <h3>1. Deepfake Video of President Zelensky</h3>
    <p>In 2022, a deepfake video emerged of Ukrainian President Zelensky telling troops to surrender. The altered footage was quickly debunked but highlighted the risks of misinformation.</p>

    <h3>2. The Irishman Movie</h3>
    <p>In the 2019 film "The Irishman," Deepfake AI was used to de-age actors, creating realistic younger versions for flashback scenes.</p>
    <p>
      The challenges with deepfake AI are significant when it comes to fake news or misinformation. The situations matter because if the technology is used to promote or complete an action that may have a major effect, it can change the situation drastically whether it becomes worse or better. The difficulty is how the user will interact with the technology and what the intentions are, similar to the saying “with great power comes great responsibility.” Using the technology well will depend on the user.
