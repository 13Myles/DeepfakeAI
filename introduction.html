    <h2>Introduction to Deepfake AI</h2>
    <p>Deepfake AI uses a type of machine learning known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have two components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Generator:</strong> Produces synthetic content by mimicking real-world patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>The Discriminator:</strong> Distinguishes between real and fake content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This technology is revolutionizing media but also presents significant ethical challenges.</p>
    <p>Deepfake AI uses a type of machine learning known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs operate with two neural networks working in opposition:
The Generator: Produces synthetic content by replicating patterns in existing data, such as images, videos, or audio.
The Discriminator: Analyzes the generated content to decide whether it appears authentic or artificial.
Through this iterative process, the generator continually refines its outputs until they become nearly indistinguishable from real content. Deepfake AI facilitates a variety of applications, including face-swapping in videos, voice imitation, and the creation of entirely fictional personas.
The term "deepfake" combines "deep learning," the AI method it utilizes, with "fake," reflecting its ability to generate highly convincing yet artificial content.
